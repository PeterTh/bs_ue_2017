# UIBK Operating Systems Lab 2017

This repository contains material required to complete exerceises for the OS lab in the 2017 summer semester, including exercise sheets and their associated materials (in the exN directories). Note that some of this material is based on previous years.

## Course Structure

The OS lab is split into two major parts:

- **Processes, scheduling and process communication**
- **Threads and thread synchronization**

Each of these will be covered over 3 to 4 weeks. At the beginning of the semester, we shortly discuss shell (specifically, `bash`) usage and programming.

You will also be asked to complete a simple C programming assignment, to ascertain for yourself whether you are ready to take this course with the expected amount of effort.

## Grading

Grades are based on the *number of exercises* you complete, the *quality of your presentation* of these exercises, and **two written tests**, one for each major subject. These tests will be programming assignments where you need to implement a small C program dealing with processes and threads, in a similar fashion to the related exercises.

Please **do not underestimate these tests**, and make sure to use the self-assessment exercise to understand whether you are ready to successfully complete this lab.

**Attendence** is mandatory, failing to attend more than two times will automatically result in a failing grade. Exercises only count as completed if the lab in which they are presented is attended.
